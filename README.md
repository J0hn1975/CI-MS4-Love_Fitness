Each page is design with very simple colours and images to showcase the island. The colours I have used are as follows:
> - Light Blue and Red for buttons

## Typography - Change for MS4
For the brand logo I have used Google Font - Lobster, and for the Lyrics (flow-test) I have used Google Font - Roboto Condensed. Everywhere else I have used the default Materialize font.

# Deployment

## Clone Locally
Clone site locally

> 1. Log in to Github and navigate to main page of repository
> 2. Click on **Code** above the list of files
> 3. Copy the link under clone to https
> 4. Open Git bash
> 5. If required change the directory to where you would like repo cloned to
> 6. Type git clone and then copy in repo URL
> 7. Press enter and repo will go through short cloning process

## Heroku

1. Create a file called ProcFile in the root directory, and add the line <code>web: python app.py</code> if the file does not already exist
2. Create a requirements.txt file by running the command <code>pip freeze > requirements.txt</code> in your terminal if the file doesn't already exist
3. Both the ProcFile and requirements.txt files should be added to your git repo in the root directory
4. Create an account on heroku.com
5. Create a new application and give it a unique name
6. In the application dashboard, navigate to the deploy section and connect your application to your git repo, by selecting your repo
7. Select the branch for example master and enable automatic deploys if desired. Otherwise, a deployment will be manual
8. The next step is to set the config variables in the Settings section
9. Set key/value pairs for the following keys: IP, MONGO_DBNAME, MONGO_URI, PORT, SECRET_KEY
10. Go to the dashboard and trigger a deployment
11. This will trigger a deployment, once the deployment has been successful click on the "Open App" link to open the app
12. If you encounter any issues accessing the build logs is a good way to troubleshoot the issue
