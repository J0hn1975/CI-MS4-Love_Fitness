## Surface - Change for MS4
## Colours
Each page is design with very simple colours and images to showcase the island. The colours I have used are as follows:
> - Light Blue and Red for buttons
> - Black text for buttons and card contents
> - Blanchedalmond for site back ground colours

## Typography - Change for MS4
For the brand logo I have used Google Font - Lobster, and for the Lyrics (flow-test) I have used Google Font - Roboto Condensed. Everywhere else I have used the default Materialize font.

## Database - Change for MS4
> For the database I have useed MongoDB. The database is made up of 3 collections;
- Genre
- Lyrics
- Users

### Genre

I have stored the different style of music using the 'genre' keyword, as this allow the user to select musical genres from a select dropdown list. 

![Genre DB Image](docs/database/genre.PNG)

### Lyrics

Any lyrics that the user adds through the application will be stored in the database, this data can will be pulled from the database and displayed on the Lyrics page.

![Lyrics DB Image](docs/database/lyrics.PNG)

### Users

The usernames and password are stored in the database as this allows the users to log in/log out securely.

![Users DB Image](docs/database/users.PNG)

### Conceptual Database Model

To help better understand the design of my database I created a conceptual model. This helped decide and plan which collections would be required.

![Conceptual Database Model](docs/database/conceptual_database_design.png)

### Physical database model

Using the conceptual database design I was able to create the physical database model. This physical database model show all the fields stored in each of the database collections.

# Bugs - Change for MS4
> **Bug** Image URL on Edit Lyrics page breaks the album artwork image  
> **Fix** Removed Image URL section of Edit Lyrics form

# Deployment

## Github Pages - Keep
I have deployed this site to GitHub pages

> 1. Log in to git hub and find the respositry you wish to deploy
> 2. On the respository click on **Settings**
> 3. From left the hand menue click on **Pages**
> 4. Click on the **Source** option
> 5. From the dropdown change **none** to **master branch**
> 6. The deplyment will take a few moments to finalise
> 7. The live site URL is now displayed under Github Pages

## Clone Locally - Keep
Clone site locally

> 1. Log in to Github and navigate to main page of repository
> 2. Click on **Code** above the list of files
> 3. Copy the link under clone to https
> 4. Open Git bash
> 5. If required change the directory to where you would like repo cloned to
> 6. Type git clone and then copy in repo URL
> 7. Press enter and repo will go through short cloning process

## Mongo Database - Delete

> 1. Create an account at mongodb
> 2. Create a database cluster
> 3. Select the cluster, and in the collections section create a database and create 5 collections under the database: memories, comments, ratings, tournaments, users
> 4. In the database access, create a user and allow the user read/write access. Note the username
> 5. In the network access tab, allow network access from the ip-address of the application connecting to the database
> 6. In the Databases section click Connect, and select connect your application
> 7. Note the MONGO_URI, MONGO_DBNAME and user, these parameters are used when deploying locally(env.py file) and deploying on the likes of heroku(config vars)

## Heroku - Change for MS4

1. In the app.py file, ensure that debug is not enabled, i.e. set to True
2. Create a file called ProcFile in the root directory, and add the line <code>web: python app.py</code> if the file does not already exist
3. Create a requirements.txt file by running the command <code>pip freeze > requirements.txt</code> in your terminal if the file doesn't already exist
5. Both the ProcFile and requirements.txt files should be added to your git repo in the root directory
6. Create an account on heroku.com
7. Create a new application and give it a unique name
8. In the application dashboard, navigate to the deploy section and connect your application to your git repo, by selecting your repo
9. Select the branch for example master and enable automatic deploys if desired. Otherwise, a deployment will be manual
10. The next step is to set the config variables in the Settings section
11. Set key/value pairs for the following keys: IP, MONGO_DBNAME, MONGO_URI, PORT, SECRET_KEY
12. Go to the dashboard and trigger a deployment
13. This will trigger a deployment, once the deployment has been successful click on the "Open App" link to open the app
14. If you encounter any issues accessing the build logs is a good way to troubleshoot the issue
